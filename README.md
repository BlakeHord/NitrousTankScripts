# NitrousTankScripts

A series of random python scripts to analyze the performance of the Stanford Ortega liquid propellant rocket engine.

- HEX.py models the performance of a nitrous-oxide heat exchanger, ignoring the convection of the water on the outside of the copper pipe
- nitrous_heating.py models the heating of an aluminum tank with nitrous oxide in blistering heat, with and without solar radiation
- nitrous_massflow.py is a first-order approximation of the flow of nitrous oxide into a tank given a set of flow coefficients (Cv)
